This is a short test to see how plain text is displayed on github.

```
Hello this is a code test
```

```javascript
var s = "Javascript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

This is a simple imported picture

![link profile picture](./images/link_profile.jpg "Title")

And this is the same picture but its size is reduced. This is done by specifying the size at the end of the line where the picture is included.

![link profile picture reduced](./images/link_profile.jpg =250x)
